This blog serves to document my work for the 2016 Google Summer of
Code project *GPU-accelerated deep neural network in TMVA* for the
*Software Development for Experiments*
 ([SFT](http://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch/)) group at
[CERN](http://home.cern/).

The *Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis in ROOT*
 ([TMVA](http://tmva.sourceforge.net/)) is a [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)
machine learning environment, which has been developed specifically
for high-energy physics applications. An implementation of deep neural
networks (DNNs) has recently been added to TMVA and the aim of this
project is to extend the current implementation to enable GPU
accelerated training of deep neural networks.
